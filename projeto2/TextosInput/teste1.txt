Department Stores
The first department storre was created in Paris, in 1850. It was conceived as a big place with a lut of options in products and brands. They wouldnâ€™t sell just a specific product: there you could  find clotthes, shoes, jewels, make up and many others things. That concept remained until today. So, if you want to buy many things with good prices, you can choose from one of the thousands in the world.

Every year, on the day after Thanksgiving, most of this stores have a big sale called Black Friday. On this day, it is possible to buy products with big discounts and you also have the option to buy things online. In 2016, more than 154 million people spent USD 3,3 billion dollars shopping only on the internet.
